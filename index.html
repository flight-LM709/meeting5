    <h2>Cars</h2>
    <p>The movie is great to look at and a lot of fun, but somehow lacks the extra push of the other Pixar films. Maybe that's because there's less at stake here, and no child-surrogate to identify with.<br>
         I wonder if the movie's primary audience, which skews young, will much care about the 1950s and its cars. Maybe they will. <br> 
         Of all decades, the 1950s seems to have the most staying power; like Archie and Jughead, the decade stays forever young, perhaps because that's when modern teenagers were invented.</p>

    <h2>Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse</h2>
    <p>Is it possible to equal a film as boundlessly inventive, stylistically bold and effortlessly cool as Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse? Could a sequel ever match that film's freshness, energy and visual verve? The answer, it seems, is an emphatic yes. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is sublime. There's not a frame of this rich, kaleidoscopically detailed animation that isn't dazzling. It takes the basic themes of the first film - adolescent isolation, communication breakdown, the messy, stressful business of growing, of finding your people - and builds whole worlds with them. It's a dizzying onslaught of ideas and graphic references. It has heart. It even has a font gag. <br>

        In the film-making team and in the story there's a pleasing combination of original talent and fresh blood. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller return as writers and producers, but there's a new directing team that includes Kemp Powers (Pixar's Soul). Once again, the story focuses on the bond between fellow Spider-people Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) and Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld). But there is a host of new characters, each with their own distinctive look, including Hobie (Daniel Kaluuya), a spider-punk anarchist, drawn with a graphic style that borrows from Jamie Reid's Sex Pistols aesthetic and Jamie Hewlett's Gorillaz. <br>
        
        It's densely plotted, almost overwhelming at times; Daniel Pemberton's score is an Escher staircase of anxiety. But the soul of the film lies in the tiny human details: like the way Miles, about to gain access to an inner Spider-circle, bounces lightly on his toes - still, at heart, an excited kid waiting for a treat.</p>

    <h2>Toy Story</h2>
    <p>Seeing "Toy Story," I felt some of the same exhilaration I felt during "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." Both movies take apart the universe of cinematic visuals, and put it back together again, allowing us to see in a new way. <br>
         "Toy Story" is not as inventive in its plotting or as clever in its wit as "Rabbit" or such Disney animated films as "Beauty and the Beast"; it's pretty much a buddy movie transplanted to new terrain. Its best pleasures are for the eyes. <br>
          But what pleasures they are! Watching the film, I felt I was in at the dawn of a new era of movie animation, which draws on the best of cartoons and reality, creating a world somewhere in between, where space not only bends but snaps, crackles and pops.</p>

    <h2>WALL‚Ä¢E</h2>
    <p>What's more, I don't think I've quite captured the film's enchanting storytelling. Directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton, who wrote and directed ‚ÄúFinding Nemo,‚Äù it involves ideas, not simply mindless scenarios involving characters karate-kicking each other into high-angle shots. <br>
         It involves a little work on the part of the audience, and a little thought, and might be especially stimulating to younger viewers. This story told in a different style and with a realistic look could have been a great science-fiction film. For that matter, maybe it is.</p>
